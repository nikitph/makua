Your Rights in California

As a resident of California, you have certain rights, such as those bulleted below. You may freely exercise these rights without fear of being denied goods or services. We may, however, provide a different level of service or charge a different rate reasonably relating to the value of your personal information.

Right to data portability/access. You may be entitled to receive the specific pieces of personal information we have collected in the 12 months preceding your request, including, where applicable, in an electronic and readily usable format.
